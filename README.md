# Snake Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. This implementation of the Snake Game is written in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

# Features
* Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys
* The snake grows longer and the player earns points by eating food
* The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body
* Restart the game by pressing the 'r' key after a game over

# Requirements
To run the Snake Game, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x: The Snake Game is implemented in Python, so you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.
You can check if Python is installed on your system by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
```````````````````
  python --version
```````````````````
If Python is not installed or the version is not 3.x, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can proceed to install the required dependencies by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
```````````````````
pip install tkinter
```````````````````
The above command installs the Tkinter library, which is used for the graphical user interface of the Snake Game.

**Note: The Tkinter library is typically included with the standard Python installation. However, in some cases, you may need to install it separately. If you encounter any issues with the Tkinter installation, please refer to the documentation or resources specific to your operating system.**

Ensure that you meet the above requirements before running the Snake Game.
